<p align="left"><font size="3" face="verdana,arial,sans-serif"><br> "Inspired by the late artificial-intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky, he designed what was dubbed the Ultimate Machine: flick the switch to “On” and a box opens up; out comes a mechanical hand, which flicks the switch back to “Off” and retreats inside the box. Shannon’s home, in Winchester, Massachusetts (Entropy House, he called it), was full of his gizmos, and his garage contained at least thirty idiosyncratic unicycles—one without pedals, one with a square tire, and a particularly confounding unicycle built for two.

<p align="left"><font size="3" face="verdana,arial,sans-serif"> I found such idea fascinating and it has an incredible sense of humor. Therefore, I create this webpage and it will open a pop-up window as the Ultimate Machine and the window will close itself after three seconds.</font></p>

<p align="left"><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,sans-serif"> <br>The beauty of this machine it can close itself, so I would like to really create a page that can actually close itself. However, for obvious secruity reason, modern browser does not allow such thing unless with so unsustainable hack so I end up using this page as a parent page to launch the machine as a child page and close it with this parent page.</font></p>
<p align="left"><font size="2" face="verdana,arial,sans-serif"> <br>NOTE:<ul>
<li>The machine will automatically open when you open up this page.</li>
<li>If the machine does not load, please enable the pop-up window for this page on you browser.</li>
</ul></font></p>
