			<p align="left"><font size="3" face="verdana,arial,sans-serif"><br> "Inspired by the late artificial-intelligence pioneer Marvin Minsky, he designed what was dubbed the Ultimate Machine: flick the switch to “On” and a box opens up; out comes a mechanical hand, which flicks the switch back to “Off” and retreats inside the box. Shannon’s home, in Winchester, Massachusetts (Entropy House, he called it), was full of his gizmos, and his garage contained at least thirty idiosyncratic unicycles—one without pedals, one with a square tire, and a particularly confounding unicycle built for two.

			<p align="left"><font size="3" face="verdana,arial,sans-serif"> I found the idea fascinating and incredibly funny. Therefore, I createed this webpage: it will open a pop-up window as the Ultimate Machine and it will close itself after three seconds.</font></p>

			<p align="left"><font size="3" face="verdana,arial,sans-serif"> <br>The beauty of this machine it can close itself, so I would like to really create a page that can actually close itself. However, for obvious secruity reason, modern browser does not allow such thing unless with so unsustainable hack so I end up using this page as a parent page to launch the machine as a child page and close it with this parent page.</font></p>
